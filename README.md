# LookOwlt
LookOwl't is a crowdsourced, event reporting app for Temple University students and staff. After attending Temple University over the last year we have noticed that many university events, maintenance issues, and emergency situations in and around campus go unnoticed by many students and staff members. 

# How It Works
LookOwl't is an Android application that will allow users to report university events, maintenance issues, and emergency situations with a picture of the event, a description of the event, and the event type (Maintenance, Emergency, Free Stuff). The report will then appear in a card-based feed that other users of the application can view on their devices. If a user sees a reported event in person, they will have the ability to increase the legitemacy of the post by giving it a thumbs up. Conversly, if a reported event is no longer taking place and a user notices this, they can give the post a thumbs down. Once a post receives 5 thumbs down, the post will be cleared from the feed, as it is no longer relevant. In addition, users have the ability to star a report that will save the report locally to their device, allowing them to revisit the report without having to scroll through the report feed to find it again.

# To Run
Open the application in Android Studio. Run on your device for best experience.
